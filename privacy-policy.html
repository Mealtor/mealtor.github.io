<p>Last updated: November 5, 2018</p>


<p>Mealtor Inc. ("us", "we", or "our") operates the mymealtor.com website and the Mealtor mobile application (the "Service").</p>

<p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data. This Privacy Policy for Mealtor Inc. is powered by <a href="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/free-privacy-policy-generator.php">FreePrivacyPolicy.com</a> and adapted from <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/Home/Privacy">AppSheet.com</a>.</p>

<p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.</p>


<h2>Information Collection And Use</h2>

<p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>

<h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

<h4>Personal Data</h4>

<p>When you sign up via a third-party authentication provider (such as Google), our service retrieves and saves some information about you from the provider. The specific information is controlled by the authentication provider and by the permissions you approve when you sign up. In particular, our service retrieves your email address. Your email address will be stored and used to retain your user preferences for the convenience of your next visit.</p>

<p>In addition to the information we collect when you sign up, you may voluntarily provide us with additional personal information. For example:</p>

<p>Your place of employment, when you complete a sales form on our website.
Addresses, telephone numbers, additional email addresses, and other personally identifiable information you provide to us through any sales and marketing forms available on our website. This type of information helps us improve our business relationship with you.<br>
Your personally identifiable information will not be sold or rented to third parties in a way that identifies you as an individual. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personally identifiable information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.</p>

<p>We may share anonymized, aggregated order information with third parties as a way to understand, explain, and analyze our business (e.g., X% of our users used feature Y).</p>

<h4>Application Data</h4>

<p>The data that your applications collect and use reside in a third-party storage provider (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.). Our service does not persist this data. However, in order to improve performance, we may temporarily cache data, images, and other files.</p>

<p>In order to interact with your data, our service maintains authentication (OAuth) tokens that allow our software to act "on your behalf" to read and write data. These tokens are securely stored along with your personal information.</p>

<h4>Usage Data</h4>

<p>Our service uses browser session cookies and browser local storage to maintain user session state. This helps to speed up user login. You can set your browser to disable cookies and local storage, but this will significantly compromise or disable product usability.</p>

<p>Our service logs usage information in encrypted log files, including the features you accessed on our site and standard browser-provided information. We use this information not only to debug issues and problems, but also to learn aggregated patterns across all our users and thereby improve our service.</p>

<p>Our service may send notifications via email and other notification mechanisms. We may employ clear gifs to track the effectiveness of our emails.</p>

<p>We may utilize multiple third-party products and services to help understand and analyze usage data on our site. Each third-party service has its own privacy policy. Mealtor commits to review third parties that receive information from Mealtor to certify their compliance to Privacy Shield Principles. Mealtor shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent (third party) processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Mealtor proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>

<p>We may share anonymized, non-personally identifiable usage data with third-party partners to understand, analyze, or explain aggregate customer usage of our service.</p>

<h4>Tracking & Cookies Data</h4>
